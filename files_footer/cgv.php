            <p class="fw-bold">1. APPLICATION</p>
            <p>
                These general sales conditions (hereinafter: “GSCs”) apply to the
                sales made by the Hotel (hereinafter: “the Company”) with the
                Client.
            </p>
            <p>
                They cancel and replace any prior version that has been placed
                online and/or accepted by the Client.
            </p>
            <p>
                These GSCs apply to all uses of the site, notably, to the
                commercialisation, by Internet and by telephone, of all of the
                services offered on the Site by ROOM.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is therefore critical that the Client read attentively the GSCs
                that are referenced by hypertext link on each page of the site. In
                particular, the Client is advised to download and/or print these on
                the day of his/her order, so as to keep a copy of these, as they are
                subject to modification. However, it is hereby stipulated that such
                modifications shall be inapplicable to the orders of Services placed
                previously.
            </p>
            <p>
                The GSCs can be supplemented by specific sales conditions contained
                in the description of the service, as well as by the general
                conditions of the providers, which can be accessed either on their
                Internet Site, or on the premises.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold">2. CAPACITY</p>
            <p>
                The Client acknowledges that s/he has the capacity to enter into a
                contract, i.e. that it is an adult as defined by law and is not
                under guardianship or trusteeship.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Client also declares that it will use the Site in accordance
                with these GSCs, in its name and on behalf of all of the
                beneficiaries of the services ordered by it on the Site, of which it
                acknowledges that it is the representative (hereinafter: the
                “Beneficiaries”) and on which these GSCs are binding.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Client is financially responsible for the use of the Site in
                both his/her own name and on behalf of the Beneficiaries, unless
                s/he demonstrates fraudulent use that does not result from any fault
                or negligence by her/him.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Client warrants the veracity and the accuracy of the information
                provided by him/her in its name and on behalf of all of the
                Beneficiaries using its data on the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Company reserves the right at any time not to enter into a
                contract with a Client who engages in fraudulent use of the Site or
                that violates these GSCs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The terms of Article 313-1 of the French Criminal Code [Code Pénal]
                are hereby recalled in this connection:
            </p>
            <p>
                "Fraud is characterised either by the use of a false name or a false
                status, or by the misuse of a genuine status, or by the use of
                fraudulent ploys to deceive a natural person or legal entity and to
                define it as such, to its prejudice or to the prejudice of a
                third-party, to submit funds, securities, or any asset, to supply a
                service, or to grant an act entailing an obligation or a release.
                Fraud is punished by five years of imprisonment and a fine of €
                375,000.”
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold">3. RIGHT TO CANCEL</p>
            <p>
                Pursuant to the provisions of Article L 121-21-8 of the French
                Consumption Code [Code de laConsommation], the services offered on
                the Site by the Company are not subject to the application of the
                right to cancel mentioned in Articles L. 121-21 et seq. of the
                Consumption Code concerning sales at a distance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consequently, the services ordered on the Site are exclusively
                subject to the cancellation and modification conditions contained in
                these GSCs and the Client cannot invoke the right to cancel.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold">4. PRICES</p>
            <p>
                The prices are indicated in euros. VAT is included in the prices
                indicated. Any change of the applicable rate, or any modification or

                mentioned in the reservation. The price mentioned in the reservation

                visitors tax.
            </p>

                conditions, acknowledgment of full cognisance thereof, and an
                undertaking not to rely on his/her own purchasing conditions or
                other conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Company shall send the Client, by any means (e-mail, regular

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                The rates, terms and conditions of reservations are intended for the
                sale of hotel rooms in accordance with their primary purpose:
                accommodation. The hotel reserves the right to modify or cancel the
                reservation (s), as well as the rates and conditions if the rooms
                are used for other purposes such as parties, dinners, meetings,

                filmed interviews, shootings for social networks, showrooms etc…

                exceed the number of people reserved and may not exceed the maximum
                capacity of the rooms declared to the Paris Police Prefecture
                (declaration available from the hotel management).
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold">6. ONLINE PAYMENT CONDITIONS</p>
            <p>
                According to the type of reservation made, the price is due in full
                at the time of the placing of the order (advance purchase style
                plan) or at the end of the Client’s stay at the Hotel (flexible
                plan).
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless of the circumstances and in order to guarantee his/her
                reservation, the Client is asked to communicate his/her credit card
                number, which shall be transmitted by secure means.
            </p>
            <p>
                If payment is made at the time the order is placed, the credit card
                information transmitted by the Client to the Company via a secure
                system shall enable the latter to debit the card for the total
                amount of the stay, in all cases by secure means. The Client’s
                credit card is debited on the day of the order; the invoice is
                transmitted by the Company to the Client on the day the Client
                leaves the Hotel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please be advised that the credit card used to make the reservation
                must be presented at check-in, as well as valid identification. The
                cardholder’s name must match the guest’s name. If the same credit
                card cannot be presented, the guest will need to present a new
                credit card for full payment to be taken.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third-Party Credit Card: if a non-guest wishes to pay for a guest in
                the hotel, the hotel will require specific documents prior to the
                guest’s arrival in order to prevent bank card fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that the hotel may proceed to a pre-authorization on
                your credit card to ensure sufficient funds are available to cover
                the charges for your stay at any time prior to arrival.
            </p>
