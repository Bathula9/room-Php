                Thank you for visiting our website and for your interest in our

                For ROOM and its Affiliates, in their capacity as Data
                Controllers, the protection of your Data is a priority. We respect
                your privacy and ensure the protection of your personal data by

                regulations, in particular Regulation 2016/679 of the European
                Parliament and Council dated 27 April 2016 concerning the protection
                of physical persons with regard to the processing of personal data
